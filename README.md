## Outcomes Based on Goal

Based off the Kickstarter data, we are determining the outcome of "Plays" from the Parent Category of "Theater" in relation to funding goals.

The analysis was based off data from the Excel file called "Kickstarter_Analysis"
* In that Excel file we performed Excel functions such as creation of Pivot Tables, Charts, Filters, VLOOKUP, and AVG
* That Excel file was also what we used for the Module 1 Challenge for determining the results of Outcomes based off goals from funding
* * However, I added the use of a couple more Charts as well as the use of COUNTIFS
* * COUNTIFS assisted me in determining the number of "successes", "fails, and "cancels" in relation to funding goals
* * * I was able to gather the charts by making a table of "successes", "fails", and "cancels" using the following Excel fomrula: =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<1000",Kickstarter!$F:$F,"successful",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays")
* * * This formauls was modified internally for use on the different categories of dollar amounts
* * * The end table was this:
* * * *
